# Renttracker
Renttracker is a one-stop shop for homeless people. When completed, it will allow you to search for areas that can provide support to homeless persons (i.e. police stations, hostels, hospitals, soup kitchens). It will also aggregate different online rent provider feeds (hence the name), allowing homeless people to find the right home for their price point. As a last resort, it will allow users to contact social services in your area for support.

Multi-platform functionality will probably be added in future, but for the moment, my priority is getting the UWP version working.
